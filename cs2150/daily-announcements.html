## Grades and regrades
- Our aim is to return the lab grades "one week" later
  - That means by Monday a week and 3 days after the post-lab is due (late deadline is on a Saturday)
  - We may not always manage this...
- All grading guidelines are posted in the [Collab wiki](https://collab.itc.virginia.edu/portal/site/415219f8-1a72-4ade-a753-b37ec6aecb61/page/cf081a8e-49ca-4fd5-8f6b-5399dafb7268) (*not* in the github repo!)
- You have 10 days, from when it was returned, to submit a regrade
  - Fill them out via the [regrades tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=regrades.php)
- Regrades are ONLY if we did not properly follow the grading guidelines in your homework
  - They are not an opportunity to make up the work!
  - Nor are they an opportunity to dispute the grading guidelines (that should be done in person)
- Regrades will not be handled in a timely fashion!
  - It's the lowest priority, and they often wait until the end of the semester
  - You can see your submitted regrade status via the [regrades tool](https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php?redirect=regrades.php)
  - You will receive an email when it is handled
